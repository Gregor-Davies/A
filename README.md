# A
A is a basic light weight anti swearing plugin for bukkit/spigot which was created as just a school project.

This plugin is full setup with no need for a config since it already has most required words to be blocked pre coded in, 
however if you need/want a word/phrase added just create a issue and I will add it or you could add it yourself buy going into the code and writing: 
word.add("Desired Word/phrase"); and it will add the word.

Installtion:
1. Click on the button on the right hand corner "Clone or download".
2. Click on the "Download as a zip" Option.
3. Extract the zip file with a program like 7zip.
4. Drop it into your plugin folder.
5. Restart your server.
6. Enjoy!

This is my very first bukkit/spigot plugin if you have any tips on how I can improve please let me know!
